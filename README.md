## 👨‍💻 About me

I’m a **JavaScript / TypeScript full-stack developer** with a strong preference for **frontend engineering** — where user experience, performance, and clean architecture meet.

I enjoy building products end-to-end, but I’m especially drawn to:
- crafting intuitive interfaces  
- understanding how browsers *really* behave  
- writing maintainable, well-tested code  

I’m constantly learning, refining fundamentals, and deepening my understanding of how systems work — from the browser, to the server, to the database.

## 🤖 AI-assisted development

AI is part of my **daily development workflow**, not a replacement for fundamentals.

I regularly work with:
- **ChatGPT** — for design discussions, debugging, refactoring, and learning
- **Codex and other AI tools** — experimenting with code generation, automation, and workflow acceleration

I use AI intentionally:
- to explore alternatives and trade-offs  
- to speed up repetitive tasks  
- to improve code clarity and documentation  

Final decisions, architecture, and quality control remain fully human.

## 🎯 Current focus

- **TypeScript** — writing safer, more expressive JavaScript at scale  
- **Frontend architecture** — state management, performance, accessibility  
- **Backend fundamentals** — APIs, databases (MySQL), and data modeling  
- **Tooling & quality** — testing, linting, automation, and developer experience  

I value clarity over cleverness and long-term maintainability over quick hacks.

## 🚀 Philosophy

> Learn deeply. Build thoughtfully. Improve continuously.

I care about code quality, developer experience, and building things that are pleasant to use — both for users and for the people maintaining them.
