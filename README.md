### I am a JavaScript Fullstack developer, whose heart belongs to frontend

So, picture this: I'm on a quest, a daring journey to unravel the mysteries of becoming a full-stack web wizard. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But how do you even begin to explain this epic odyssey?

But fear not, brave souls! Here's a glimpse into my formidable 'must-learn' agenda:

- **Javascript** - no idea how deep this goes...  just when you think you've hit the bottom, you discover there's a whole new level of depth waiting to be explored. üåä
- **Databases** - Specifically MYSQL, but who says I can't dip into other data realms as well?
- **Front-end magic**: From understanding the quirky behavior of browsers to cookies üç™ (yes, please, with a side of butter!). 
- **Tech exploration** Building a solid foundation of understanding computer systems. This seems like trying to build a skyscraper on a foundation made of Jenga blocks ‚Äì one wrong move, and it all comes crashing down. But fear not, for I shall be the architect of my own digital destiny! üèóÔ∏è

So, there you have it ‚Äì my epic saga of becoming a full-stack web developer, complete with twists, turns, and a healthy dose of humor. Onward, to the coding adventures that await! üöÄ
